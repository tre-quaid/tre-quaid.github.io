title: "First Iteration of My Personal Website"

Welcome to the first version of my personal website.

I built this site using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and GitHub Pages to showcase my skills, projects, and repair work. I kept the design simple with a terminal-style theme because it reflects how I like to work — straightforward, practical, and hands-on.

Right now the site includes:
- An **About** page with info about my background and skills
- A **Contact** page if you want to reach me for tech repair or freelance work
- A **Projects** section to highlight what I've built or fixed
- This **blog**, where I’ll be writing about repairs, builds, and whatever tech problems I’m solving

I’m planning to update the site regularly as I work on more projects. Eventually I might add a gallery, a résumé download, or even a contact form.

Thanks for checking it out.
