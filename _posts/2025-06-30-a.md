Welcome to the first version of my personal website.

I built this site using Jekyll and GitHub Pages just for fun and to share my interests. I kept the design simple with a terminal-style theme because it reflects how I like to work — straightforward, practical, and hands-on.

Right now the site includes:

    An About page with info about me and my hobbies
    A Contact page if you want to get in touch
    A Projects section to showcase things I’ve built or experimented with
    This blog, where I’ll be writing about tech, projects, and whatever else I find interesting

I’m planning to update the site regularly as I explore new ideas. Eventually I might add a gallery, some downloadable content, or other fun features.

Thanks for stopping by and checking it out.
