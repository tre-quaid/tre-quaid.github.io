Hi, i've been working on a desktop app that I’m really excited to finally share. What I made is a room decorator, the idea is to give people a way to design a room layout 
using furniture they already own or plan to get, and arrange it visually before doing all the heavy lifting in real life.

Room Decorator lets you drag and drop items like beds, tables, and sofas onto a virtual room. You can also draw walls, add doors, and even upload a background photo of 
your actual space if you want to match everything more accurately.

One of my favorite parts is how easy it is to rotate items or snap them into place using a grid. There’s also a “door swing arc” feature that shows how 
far a door opens, so you don’t accidentally block anything important.

Here is the download link if you would like to try it:
