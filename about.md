# About Me
    Hi, I’m Tre Quaid. I’m a curious and creative problem solver who enjoys learning how things work and finding better ways to do them. Whether it’s building something from scratch or improving an existing idea, I like working with both my hands and my mind. Outside of projects, I’m always picking up new skills and exploring anything that grabs my interest.
