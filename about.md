# About Me
    I’m Tre Quaid, a self-taught tech builder and fixer from Arkansas.
    I’ve been repairing laptops, building gaming PCs, and solving hardware issues for years,
    just because I love doing it.

    I specialize in hands-on tech: 
    diagnostics, hardware upgrades, software cleanup, and full custom PC builds.
    I’ve also done some Arduino robotics and enjoy troubleshooting complex problems.
